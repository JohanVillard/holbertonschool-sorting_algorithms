## Task 0. Bubble sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

- Prototype: ```void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);```
- You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

## Task 1. Selection sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

- Prototype: ```void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);```
- You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case
